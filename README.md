### Time of Project: Spring 2021

### Ph.D. in Information Technology Program, UTSA

For a class project, [johnrodriguez190380](https://github.com/johnrodriguez190380) and I took on the [SemEval 2021 Task 6" Detection of Persuasion Techniques in Texts and Images."](https://propaganda.math.unipd.it/semeval2021task6/) We did sub-task 3.

The goal was to develop a multi-modal data model for multi-label propaganda classification in online memes. By combining various NLP & Computer Vision methods, we achieved F1 Micro scores ranging 0.38 to 0.53 in testing. All coding and analysis was done in Python. Please see our [presentation](https://github.com/iscarff123/SemEval2021-Task6.3-ClassProject/raw/main/Final%20Presentation.pptx) and our [final report](https://github.com/iscarff123/SemEval2021-Task6.3-ClassProject/blob/main/Final%20Report.pdf) for more details about the project and of our work.
